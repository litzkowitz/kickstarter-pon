        <p>The design has a unique patent pending geometry within its coil to hug objects so you don't have to stab them. Just slide what you want to display inside the coil. There's even a special angle in the coil that allows for objects to be inserted without crumpling.</p>

        <h3>Pon is easy to use, flexible, small, and versatile</h3>
        <p>Pon was designed to have just the right amount of spirals to maintain a full grip and can hold thick objects like coasters and album jackets, or many layers of small objects like reminder notes. It's made from heat-treated stainless steel that allows it to spring back to it's original shape even after it's expanded.</p>
        <p> It is about the same size as a regular thumb tack and can do some serious heavy lifting.</p>
